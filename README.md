# Description

---

A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces, typically employed to authenticate users.

While humans can recognize faces without much effort, facial recognition is a challenging pattern recognition problem in computing. Facial recognition systems attempt to identify a human face, which is three-dimensional and changes in appearance with lighting and facial expression, based on its two-dimensional image. To accomplish this computational task, facial recognition systems perform four steps. First face detection is used to segment the face from the image background. In the second step, the segmented face image is aligned to account for face pose, image size, and photographic properties, such as illumination and grayscale. The purpose of the alignment process is to enable the accurate localization of facial features in the third step, the facial feature extraction. Features such as eyes, nose, and mouth are pinpointed and measured in the image to represent the face. The so established feature vector of the face is then, in the fourth step, matched against a database of faces.

# Applications of Face Recognition

---

1. Apple uses facial recognition to help users quickly unlock their phones, log in to apps, and make purchases.
2. Facebook began using facial recognition in the US in 2010 when it automatically tagged people in photos using its tag suggestions tool. The tool scans a user's face and offers suggestions about who that person is.
3. McDonaldâ€™s has used facial recognition in its Japanese restaurants to assess the quality of customer service provided there, including analyzing whether its employees are smiling while assisting customers.

Computer Vision refers to machine learning to analyze, understand and respond to digital images or videos. Applying algorithms to input from digital data allows visual information to be converted into data that can be processed and evaluated for patterns.

# Applications of Computer Vision

**Image classification** 

An image can be classified using it. It can accurately predict that a given image belongs to a particular class.
E.g., A social media company would need to use it to automatically identify and segregate harmful content uploaded by users.

**Object detection** 

Image classification is used to identify a specific image class and then detect and tabulate their appearance in an image or video. Examples include detecting damages on an assembly line or identifying machinery that requires maintenance.

**Object tracking** 

It can track an object once it is identified. This task is often executed with images captured in sequence or real-time video feeds. Autonomous vehicles, for example, need not only to classify and detect objects such as pedestrians, other cars and road infrastructure, but they also need to track them in motion to avoid collisions and obey traffic laws.
